# Installation

Not much to say here. Run the `Sawczyn.EFDesigner.EFModel.DslPackage.vsix` file to install the extension into Visual Studio. VS2019 is required, but any edition of VS2019 should work.

The easiest way to get the package is through the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=michaelsawczyn.EFDesigner). You can install it from Visual
Studio via `Extensions/Manage Extensions` menu, which will help keep it up-to-date as updates are posted.

If you're interested in builds that aren't yet posted to the Marketplace, you can visit [the project's Github repository](https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner)
for newer (and less reliable) releases.
