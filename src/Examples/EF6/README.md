# Entity Framework Visual Editor - Examples
An open source EF GUI tool works and here are some examples of how you get setup to use it..
ENTITY FRAMEWORK is a modern ORM way of using DB access.  EF itself is robust and solid

## This tool makes it easy to visualise, create and maintain complex relational databases
Uses GUI models and classes to setup data that is then easily stored in a Database.

## What about Microsofts ADO.Net Visual Modeller [.edmx]
The Entity framework Microsoft ADO.Net modeller GUI wrapper for 'Code first' and 'Fluent API' modelling tool .edmx is **fragile and incomplete.**

### Microsofts GUI Database Model tool ".EDMX" visual tools DO NOT WORK
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/data-tools/entity-data-model-tools-in-visual-studio?view=vs-2019

Unfortunatley the 'Code first' and 'Fluent API' are console like commands that require a deep dive to utilise and apply to your requirements.
Not using a GUI tool means 10K hrs investment to become proficent :(


###  Not using an ORM ? 
   The no ORM (Object Relationship Model) of doing Basic Database Operations is using C# hand crafted SQL CRUD [Create/Read/Update /Delete]
   Works for simple database work but does not scale and is hard to maintiain / visualise.
