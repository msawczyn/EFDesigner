# Entity Framework Designer - VS2019 Version

## Entity Framework visual design surface and code-first code generation for EF6, EFCore and beyond.

### This package is for VS2019. The VS2022 version is available in the [EFDesigner2022](https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner2022) project

Model and generate code for both Entity Framework v6.x and Entity Framework Core 2.x, 3.x and 5.

**[Install with NuGet](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/finding-and-using-visual-studio-extensions) from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=michaelsawczyn.EFDesigner)**

This Visual Studio 2019 extension is the easiest way to add a consistently correct Entity Framework (EF6 or EFCore) model to your project. 

It's an opinionated code generator, adding a new file type (.efmodel) that allows for fast, easy and, most importantly, **visual** design 
of persistent classes. Inheritance, unidirectional and bidirectional associations are all supported. Enumerations are also included in 
the visual model, as is the ability to add text blocks to explain potentially arcane parts of your design.

While giving you complete control over how the code is generated you'll be able to create, out of the box, sophisticated, 
consistent and **correct** Entity Framework code that can be regenerated when your model changes. And, since the code is written using 
partial classes, any additions you make to your generated code are retained across subsequent generations.
The designer doesn't need to be present to use the code that's generated - it generates standard C#, using the code-first, fluent API - so the tool doesn't
become a dependency to your project.

If you are used to the EF visual modeling that comes with Visual Studio, you'll be pretty much at home.
The goal was to duplicate at least those features and, in addition, 
add all the little things that *should* have been there. Things like: 
*   importing entities from C# source, or existing DbContext definitions (including their entities) from compiled EF6 or EFCore assemblies
*   multiple views of your model to highlight important aspects of your design
*   the ability to show and hide parts of the model
*   easy customization of generated output by editing or even replacing the T4 templates
*   entities by default generated as partial classes so the generated code can be easily extended
*   class and enumeration nodes that can be colored to visually group the model
*   different concerns being generated into different subdirectories (entities, enums, dbcontext)
*   string length, index flags, required attributes and other properties being available in the designer

and many other nice-to-have bits.

Code generation is completely customizable via T4 templates. The tool installs templates that 
target both EF6 and EFCore, and generate both a code-first DbContext class and 
POCO entity classes. The EF6 template's DbContext code is written to allow consumption in 
ASP.Net Core in addition to any other project type, so you'll have flexibility in your development.

**Note:** This tool does not reverse engineer from the database (i.e., "database-first"). Microsoft has provided
tools for that, and there are other, well-maintained opensourced projects that provide that functionality as
well. 

You can read more about how to use the designer in the [Documentation site](https://msawczyn.github.io/EFDesigner/).

### Change Log

**3.0.8**

   - Autoproperty setting for End1 on association wasn't persisting, so reloading the model lost that change

<details>
<summary><b>3.0.7</b></summary>

   - Fixed a number of issues with importing compiled assemblies
   - Fixed coloring of cascade delete associations when flagged on the model (see https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/291)   
   - Fixed missing '$' in generator template that was generating bad code for table schemas (see https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/289)
   - Restored auto-instantiation of dependent objects in entity constructors (see https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/287)
   - Added Microsoft.VisualStudio.Modeling.Components.15.0.dll to DslPackage assembly (see https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/293)
   - Removed validations on model open/load that prevented a misconfigured model from loading. Errors will still be shown during editing and when saving.
   - New context menu item to add class elements at the cursor position on a diagram (thanks to dcastenholz for the addition)
   - New context menu item to generate code from the Solution Explorer (thanks to dcastenholz for the addition)
   - Method visibility changes to allow MEF extensions to supply new icons and to layout a diagram (thanks to dcastenholz for the addition)

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>3.0.6</b></summary>

   - Added ability to copy current diagram to clipboard
   - DbContext fix for configuring associations with backing fields
   - Code generation fix for associations with backing fields

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>3.0.5</b></summary>

   - Fix where parsing EF version numbers should be culture-neutral (see https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/282)
   - Fixed circular logic flaw in identity properties for database views (see https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/275)
   - Corrected tracking property access modes from the default to overrides in entity attributes

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>3.0.4</b></summary>

   - Added context menu choice to visually align node elements on diagrams.
   - Fix for detecting correct EF version when anything with "Latest" in it is configured (see https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/266)
   - Fix to generate correct initial value code for decimal properties (see https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/268)

   - Generated code now honors the ExcludeFromMigration setting for a class

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>3.0.2</b></summary>

   - Added setting on designer surface to set visibility defaults for entity default constructors, and overrides for that setting on the entities
   - Added `public bool ModelAttribute.IsForeignKeyProperty` for use by developers doing custom code generation from the model
   - Added option for turning off DbSet and table name pluralization (see https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/246)
   - Added option for how to name foreign key shadow properties - either with or without underscores (see https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/250)
   - Added option to generate DbContextFactory class, for use in context pooling. Asking for DbContext factory method generation disables generating OnCreating method, since they don't play well together.
   - Changed property editor for custom attributes to be multiline, to ease editing (see https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/251)
   - Fixes for code generation of new EFCore5 database collation options
   - Fixed condition where sometimes generated code in entity default constructors would create infinitely recursive calls
   - Stopped escaping standard XML comment tags in summary and description fields (see https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/248)
   - Due to the new seeding needs in EFCore5, setters for identity properties are now public even if set to be auto-generated

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>3.0.1</b></summary>

   - Added [Description] attribute (to classes, properties, enums and enum values where summary was non-blank) to facilitate tooling use
   - Fixed an issue where EFCore5 code was generating cascade delete commands in the wrong place (see https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/243)
   - Editing class properties and enum values as text now retains properties that aren't available in the text syntax (see https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/242)

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>3.0</b></summary>

   - Now supports EFCore5.X 
      - Added `System.Net.IPAddress` and `System.Net.NetworkInformation.PhysicalAddress` to the list of available property types
      - Added ability to specify both default database collation and a collation override at the property level 
      - Many-to-many bidirectional associations are now allowed 
      - Any property type can now be used as an identity 
      - Can now customize backing field names for non-AutoProperty properties 
      - Properties with backing fields (i.e., non-AutoProperty properties) can now choose how EF will read/write those values (see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/modeling/backing-field).
      - Added support for keyless entity types created by defining queries
      - Added support for keyless entity types coming from database views
   - Default code generation type is now the latest version of EFCore (currently, 5.0)
   - Added ability to globally add and remove exposed foreign key properties to all modeled entities (via menu command) (see https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/223)
   - Added ability to choose to place newly imported model elements on the diagram where they were dropped. Caution: this can be EXTREMELY slow for large imports. (see https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/225)
   - Added composition and aggregation indicators to association connectors
   - Fixed inability to paste enumerations using diagram copy/paste
   - Changing an identity property's type now changes the type of any defined foreign-key properties pointing to that identity property
   - Title text color didn't always change when class/enum fill color changed in the diagram
   - Selecting tabs or spaces for indentation in generated code has been moved to a property on the designer surface.
   - Added `ModelRoot.IsEFCore5Plus` convenience property. It can be used in custom T4 edits
   - Possibly breaking changes: 
      - T4 template structure has been changed drastically to simplify managing code generation for the various EF versions.
        If customized T4 templates have been added to a project, they'll still work, but enhancements will continue to be made only to the new, more 
        object-oriented, T4 structure. Updating the model's .tt file to use the new template structure is quite simple; details will be in the documentation 
        at https://msawczyn.github.io/EFDesigner/Customizing.html

   - Hid comments in model explorer because they just cluttered up the tree.
   - **[NEW]** Associations now show up in their own compartment in a class on the design surface. Note that this changes the height of your elements, so the first time opening a model you may have to tweak your esthetics a bit.
   - **[NEW]** Double-clicking a class or enum on the designer opens the generated code file, if it exists. If it doesn't exist, you're asked if you'd like to generate the model then, if you do, it tries again.
   - Known issue: EFCore projects won't ask to generate the code if they can't open the file; they just fail silently. 

**1.2.6.7**
   - An entity's concurrency token property is no longer a required parameter in its constructor (https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/24)
   - Simplified cascade delete settings in property editor for associations
   - Fixed bad code generation in EFCore for cascade delete overrides (https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/22)
   - Missing files when generating code for .NET Core projects fixed
   - Tightened up and swatted some bugs in INotifyPropertyChanged handling. Added documentation to doc site for this feature (following up on https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/23)
   - Ensured multiline editing was available in property window for those properties that made sense

**1.2.6.6**
   - **[NEW]** Deleting a generalization or superclass gives the choice of pushing attributes and associations down to the former child class(es)

**1.2.6.5**
   - Comment elements now wrap the text
   - Multiline editor available in property window for element comment descriptions and Comment element text
   - Xml format changed for .efmodel file - can't be loaded by any version < 1.2.6.3
   - Support for automatic migration to new model xml formats

**1.2.6.2**
   - Added XML docs to DbContext, DatabaseInitializer and DbMigrationsConfiguration
   - **[NEW]** Enabled drag and drop reordering of enum values and class properties
   - Gave some color to the enum value glyph in the model explorer - it was so boring!
   - **[NEW]** Class properties and enum values with warnings now show a warning icon on the design surface
   - **[NEW]** Design surface has a property to turn on or off the display of the warning icons 
   - Recategorized a few "Misc" properties on the design surface

**1.2.5.1**
   - Addressed [issue #20 - Abstract/inherited/TPC code still there for abstract class](https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/20). While the discussion centered around abstract classes and TPC inheritance (which was behaving properly), it did uncover a problem with code generation when namespaces changed from class to class. 

**1.2.5.0**
   - Fix for [issue #19 - Recognize "Id" as primary key on import](https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/19)

**1.2.4.0**
   - Retargeted immediate error and warning messages to Visual Studio output window rather than error window so they could be cleared
   - Added drag validation to Generalization (inheritance) tool
   - Automatically propagate enum name and value name changes to classes that use them

**1.2.3.3**
   - Reverted the selection of the node in the model explorer when an element is selected in the diagram. Was causing bad user experience.
   - Fix for bad code generation when a class has multiple properties that each have an darabase index specified.

**1.2.3.0**
   - **[NEW]** When element selected in model explorer, no longer highlights in orange but instead selects, centers and zooms the element.
     This was done because the color change flagged the model as modified, making the user either undo or save the changes to keep
     source control happy.
   - **[NEW]** Selecting an element in the diagram also selects it in the model explorer
   - Fix for [issue #12 - Cascade delete](https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/14). Added another enum value for delete behavior (now is Cascade, None and Default)
     and changed code generation to force no cascade delete if set to 'None' ('None' used to mean 'Use the default behavior', which is now, more explicitly, the 'Default'
     option).
   - Fix for [issue #13 - Unique index not generated in EF6](https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/13).
   - Fix for [issue #14 - Table with two Primary keys not generated properly in context](https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/14). Many thanks to @Falthazar!
   - Fix for [issue #18 - Adds ValueGeneratedNever if identity type is Manual](https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/pull/18). Again, hats off to @Falthazar!

      - Ability to tag model as a specific EF version (especially useful for EF Core as new capabilities are being added often)
      - Support for dependent (complex/owned) types 
      - Option to generate dependent types in a separate directory
      - Output directory overrides for classes and enums
      - On model save, can optionally automatically install EF NuGet packages for the model's EF type and version

**1.0.3.9**
   - If no entities and model is using an unsupported inheritance strategy, 
     changing from EF6 to EFCore doesn't give a message, just changes the strategy.
   - **[NEW]** Added IsFlags attribute (and matching validations and behavior) to Enums
   - NGENed extension assembly
