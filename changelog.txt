4.0.0
   - Added EFCore 6 support

3.1.0
   - Fix generalizations in assembly import
   - Add DbContextFactory generation on request

3.0.8
   - Autoproperty setting for End1 on association wasn't persisting, so reloading the model lost that change

3.0.7
   - Fixed a number of issues with importing compiled assemblies
   - Fixed coloring of cascade delete associations when flagged on the model (see https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/291)   
   - Fixed missing '$' in generator template that was generating bad code for table schemas (see https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/289)
   - Restored auto-instantiation of dependent objects in entity constructors (see https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/287)
   - Added Microsoft.VisualStudio.Modeling.Components.15.0.dll to DslPackage assembly (see https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/293)
   - Removed validations on model open/load that prevented a misconfigured model from loading. Errors will still be shown during editing and when saving.

   - Added option for how to name foreign key shadow properties - either with or without underscores (see https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/250)
   - Added option to generate DbContextFactory class, for use in context pooling. Asking for DbContext factory method generation disables generating OnCreating method, since they don't play well together.
   - Changed property editor for custom attributes to be multiline, to ease editing (see https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/251)
   - Fixes for code generation of new EFCore5 database collation options
   - Fixed condition where sometimes generated code in entity default constructors would create infinitely recursive calls
   - Stopped escaping standard XML comment tags in summary and description fields (see https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/248)
   - Due to the new seeding needs in EFCore5, setters for identity properties are now public even if set to be auto-generated
   
3.0.1
   - Added [Description] attribute (to classes, properties, enums and enum values where summary was non-blank) to facilitate tooling use
   - Fixed an issue where EFCore5 code was generating cascade delete commands in the wrong place (see https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/243)

      - Added support for keyless entity types created by defining queries
      - Added support for keyless entity types coming from database views
   - Enhancements and Fixes
      - Added ability to globally add and remove exposed foreign key properties to all modeled entities (via menu command) (see https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/223)
      - Added ability to choose to place newly imported model elements on the diagram where they were dropped. Caution: this can be EXTREMELY slow for large imports. (see https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/225)
      - Added composition and aggregation indicators to association connectors
      - Default code generation type is now the latest version of EFCore (currently, 5.0)
      - Fixed inability to paste enumerations using diagram copy/paste
      - Changing an identity property's type now changes the type of any defined foreign-key properties pointing to that identity property
      - Title text color didn't always change when class/enum fill color changed in the diagram
      - Selecting tabs or spaces for indentation in generated code has been moved to a property on the designer surface.
      - Added ModelRoot.IsEFCore5Plus convenience property. It can be used in custom T4 edits
   - Possibly breaking changes
      - T4 template structure has been changed drastically to simplify managing code generation for the various EF versions.
        If customized T4 templates have been added to a project, they'll still work, but enhancements will continue to be made only to the new, more 
        object-oriented, T4 structure. Updating the model's .tt file to use the new template structure is quite simple; details will be in the documentation 
        at https://msawczyn.github.io/EFDesigner/Customizing.html

2.0.5.7
   - Added ability to select tabs or spaces for indentation in generated code (Tools/Options/Entity Framework Visual Editor/Visual Editor Options) (See https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/221)
   - Fixed an issue with changing visual grid size on design surface.

2.0.4
   - Added ability to hide foreign key property names on association connectors in diagrams
   - Attribute glyphs (except for Warning glyphs) in diagrams are now reflected in Model Explorer
   - Sped up reverse engineering a compiled assembly. As a consequence, the diagram is no longer updated when the assembly is imported (but that tended to ruin the diagram anyway)
   - Fix: Self-associations didn't appear when existing class is added to new diagram from the Model Explorer
   - Fix: Diagram no longer loses focus after its saved
   - Fix: Errors when copy/paste between diagrams in same model
   - Fix: Generalization links weren't being handled property when reverse engineering a compiled assembly
   - Fix: Under certain circumstances, declared foreign keys could erroneously be created for EF6 1-1 relationships. EF6 doesn't support this.

   - Added ability to search the model explorer for class and attribute names
   - Comments can also be hidden like classes and enumerations
   - Fix: Changing String Column Name Clears Max Length Property (See https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/173)

   - Fix: Attributes only show up on diagram where they were added (See https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/179)
   - Fix: EFDesigner 2.0.1 won't create entities in the efmodel for existing poco .cs files (See https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/182)

2.0.0
   - Dropped support for Visual Studio 2017; was getting to be too much to keep the tool viable for that Visual Studio version.
   - It's now possible to have multiple diagrams for the same model, each showing a different view and synchronized as the model changes. Perfect for helping to understand large models.
   - Added ability to specify foreign key properties (See https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/55)
   - Foreign key properties have a unique glyph so they can be easily picked out of the crowd
   - Foreign key properties that are primary keys also have a unique but different glyph
   - Completely restructured assembly parsers; they now cleanly handle all valid combinations of EF6/EFCore2/EFCore3 and .NETCore2/.NETCore3/.NETFramework
   - Modified assembly parsers to find declared foreign keys and add them to the model appropriately
   - Added options dialog (Tools/Options/Entity Framework Visual Editor)

   - Join tables in many-to-many associations can now have custom names (EF6 only, until EFCore supports many-to-many cardinalities)
   - Removing an enumeration removes all entity properties that use that enumeration, after displaying a warning.
   - Designer has optional visual grid with color, size and snap-to-grid options available
   - Renamed toolbox category to "EF Model Diagrams"
   - Enhanced display of model elements in the Visual Studio property window's object list
   - Removed MSAGL layouts. No one understood them anyway.
   - Removed tool automatically installing NuGet packages. Too volatile.
   - Fix: OutputDirectory lost on reload (See https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/144)
   - Fix: Unidirectional Many-to-One Association missing Required (See https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/145)

   - Fix: bad merge broke MaxLength and MinLength properties in entity string properties (See https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/103)
   - Fix: attribute parser ("edit as code" feature) didn't handle enumeration initial values well; it does now (See https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/104)
   - Fix: showing cascade delete in the designer worked inconsistently (See https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/108)
   - Fix: drag and drop developed regressions (See https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/112 and https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/114)

   - Removed visibility option for setters of automatic identity properties. 

1.3.0.6 
   - Added a model fixup for when user doesn't use full enumeration name for a property's initial value in an entity (See https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/82)
   - To more fully support DDD models, added a toggle for persisting either the property or its backing field (if not an autoproperty) for EFCore
   - Can now override the NotifyPropertyChanged value for an entity on a per-property and per-association basis
   - Fix: Removed stray quote marks in default values for string properties (See https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/86)

   - Better formatting for XML comment docs
   - Added autoproperty toggle for association ends, allowing for implementation of partial methods to examine and/or override association getting and setting
   - Removed experimental method added in 1.2.6.22 for generation of orphan association cleanup. The experiment failed :-(
   - Documentation enhancements
   - Change in generated code to eliminate name clashes in certain circumstances (See https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/48)
   - Fix: Removed duplicate indices being created for key fields
   - Fix: Setting different value than default produces duplicated HasColumnType call in EF Core (See https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/58). Thanks to tdabek (https://github.com/tdabek) for the PR!
   - Fix: "Defining ColumnType causes error in generated DBContext" (See https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/64)
   - Fix: "EFCore indexed column not generated and support for multi column indexing" (See https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/62)

1.2.6.13
   - Bugfix to remove unnecessary permission requests to push attributes down when deleting leaf nodes in an inheritance tree
   - Fix to workaround Visual Studio pulling in the wrong System.Net.Http reference. (See https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/296293/vs2017-1575-ignores-the-hintpath-and-take-the-syst.html)
   - Add EFModel.xsd to Visual Studio schema cache in order to avoid editor warnings for missing schema
   - Fixed template issue for non-English-language systems (where Microsoft Pluralization Service is unavailable)
   - Added compartment for association sources so Bidirectional associations would show up

1.2.6.11
   - Tweak to force association end roles to be correct when roles or multiplicities change
   - Attribute elements' "String Properties" don't appear unless the attribute is a string
   - Attribute elements' "Indexed Unique" property doesn't appear unless the attribute has "Indexed" equal to "True"
   - Fixed background color on attribute glyph in model explorer
   - Fixed foreground color on enum value glyph on design surface
   - Hid comments in model explorer because they just cluttered up the tree.
   - Associations now show up in their own compartment in a class on the design surface. Note that this changes the height of your elements, so the first time opening a model you may have to tweak your esthetics a bit.
   - Double-clicking a class or enum on the designer opens the generated code file, if it exists. If it doesn't exist, you're asked if you'd like to generate the model then, if you do, it tries again.
      - Known issue: EFCore/.NETCore and EFCore/.NETFramework projects won't ask to generate the code if they can't open the file; they just fail silently. All other EF/.NET combinations behave appropriately.

1.2.6.7
   - An entity's concurrency token property is no longer a required parameter in its constructor (https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/24)
   - Simplified cascade delete settings in property editor for associations
   - Fixed bad code generation in EFCore for cascade delete overrides (https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/22)
   - Missing files when generating code for .NET Core projects fixed
   - Tightened up and swatted some bugs in INotifyPropertyChanged handling. Added documentation to doc site for this feature (following up on https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/23)
   - Ensured multiline editing was available in property window for those properties that made sense

1.2.6.6
   - Deleting a generalization or superclass gives the choice of pushing attributes and associations down to the former child class(es)

1.2.6.5
   - Comment elements now wrap the text
   - Multiline editor available in property window for element comment descriptions and Comment element text
   - Xml format changed for .efmodel file - can't be loaded by any version < 1.2.6.3
   - Support for automatic migration to new model xml formats

1.2.6.2
   - Added XML docs to DbContext, DatabaseInitializer and DbMigrationsConfiguration
   - Enabled drag and drop reordering of enum values and class properties
   - Gave some color to the enum value glyph in the model explorer - it was so boring!
   - Class properties and enum values with warnings now show a warning icon on the design surface
   - Design surface has a property to turn on or off the display of the warning icons 
   - Recategorized a few "Misc" properties on the design surface

1.2.5.1
   - Addressed issue #20 - Abstract/inherited/TPC =code still there for abstract class (https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/20). While the
     discussion centered around abstract classes and TPC inheritance (which was behaving properly), it did uncover a problem with code generation when
     namespaces changed from class to class. 

1.2.5.0
   - Fix for issue #19 - Recognize "Id" as primary key on import (https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/19)

1.2.4.0
   - Retargeted immediate error and warning messages to Visual Studio output window rather than error window so they could be cleared
   - Added drag validation to Generalization (inheritance) tool
   - Automatically propagate enum name and value name changes to classes that use them

1.2.3.3
   - Reverted the selection of the node in the model explorer when an element is selected in the diagram. 
     Was causing bad user experience.
   - Fix for bad code generation when a class has multiple properties that each have an darabase index specified.

1.2.3.0
   - When element selected in model explorer, no longer highlights in orange but instead selects, centers and zooms the element.
     This was done because the color change flagged the model as modified, making the user either undo or save the changes to keep
     source control happy.
   - Selecting an element in the diagram also selects it in the model explorer
   - Fix for issue #12 - Cascade delete (https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/14). Added another enum value for delete behavior (now is Cascade, None and Default)
     and changed code generation to force no cascade delete if set to 'None' ('None' used to mean 'Use the default behavior', which is now, more explicitly, the 'Default'
     option).
   - Fix for issue #13 - Unique index not generated in EF6 (https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/13).
   - Fix for issue #14 - Table with two Primary keys not generated properly in context (https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/14). Many thanks to @Falthazar!
   - Fix for issue #18 - Adds ValueGeneratedNever if identity type is Manual (https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/pull/18). Again, hats off to @Falthazar!

   - Updated a few warning and error messages to make them more meaningful
   - Fixes for how dependent types work
   - Remove stale error and warnings prior to save (still a few left hanging around that need looked at)
   - Fixed a few null reference errors

1.2.0.0
   - New Features
      - Roslyn-based code analysis now allows dragging C# files onto the design surface to add or update classes and enums
      - Can add INotifyPropertyChanged interface and implementation for entities
      - Ability to tag model as a specific EF version (especially useful for EF Core as new capabilities are being added often)
      - Support for dependent (complex/owned) types 
      - Option to generate dependent types in a separate directory
      - Output directory overrides for classes and enums
      - On model save, can optionally automatically install EF NuGet packages for the model's EF type and version
      - Context menu action to expand and collapse selected classes and enums
