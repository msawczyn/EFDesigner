1.2.3
   - When element selected in model explorer, no longer highlights in orange but instead selects, centers and zooms the element.
     This was done because the color change flagged the model as modified, making the user either undo or save the changes to keep
     source control happy.
   - Selecting an element in the diagram also selects it in the model explorer
   - Fix for issue #14 - Table with two Primary keys not generated properly in context (https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/14). Many thanks to @Falthazar!
   - Fix for issue #12 - Cascade delete (https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/14). Added another enum value for delete behavior (now is Cascade, None and Default)
     and changed code generation to force no cascade delete if set to 'None' ('None' used to mean 'Use the default behavior', which is now, more explicitly, the 'Default'
     option).

1.2.2
   - Fix issue with association role end changing without the other side autoatically changing
   - Fix issue with deleting a highlighted element throwing an error when trying to save the file
   - Fixed code generation for dependent classes
   - Designer now automatically saves before generating code

1.2.1
   - Bug fix for inheritance strategy automatically changing to table-per-hierarchy if targeting EF Core
   - Updated a few warning and error messages to make them more meaningful
   - Fixes for how dependent types work
   - Remove stale error and warnings prior to save (still a few left hanging around that need looked at)
   - Fixed a few null reference errors

1.2.0 
   - New Features
      - Roslyn-based code analysis now allows dragging C# files onto the design surface to add or update classes and enums
      - Can add INotifyPropertyChanged interface and implementation for entities
      - Ability to tag model as a specific EF version (especially useful for EF Core as new capabilities are being added often)
      - Support for dependent (complex/owned) types 
      - Option to generate dependent types in a separate directory
      - Output directory overrides for classes and enums
      - On model save, can optionally automatically install EF NuGet packages for the model's EF type and version
      - Context menu action to expand and collapse selected classes and enums 
   - Enhancements
      - Added ability to add/edit enum values via text in the same way properties can be added/edited in classes
      - Property grid hides element properties if they're not appropriate for the EF version
      - Inheritance strategy automatically changes to table-per-hierarchy if targeting EF Core
      - Context property "Database Type" changed to "SqlServer Type" to better reflect what it does
      - Selecting an element in the Model Explorer highlights it on the diagram

   - Added MEF extension capability (see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/modeling/extend-your-dsl-by-using-mef)
   - Added some unit tests
   - Added some documentation updates
   - Changed version to 1.1.0 due to MEF capability

1.0.3.9
   - If no entities and model is using an unsupported inheritance strategy, 
     changing from EF6 to EFCore doesn't give a message, just changes the strategy.
   - Added IsFlags attribute (and matching validations and behavior) to Enums
   - NGENed extension assembly

1.0.3.8
   - Fixed project item placement
   - Added change checks to diagram so dirty flag doesn't set when nothing changes

1.0.3.6
   - Fixed parser errors when editing model attributes as text
   - Fixed error when auto-generating on save and design surface is not the active window
   - Fixed crash when used on non-English-language systems (where Microsoft Pluralization Service is unavailable)
   - Added option to generate warnings if no documentation
   - Standardized warning and error message structure
   - Added ability to choose 'None' DatabaseInitializer type; generates SetInitializer(null)

1.0.3.5
   - Enhanced portability between EF6 an EFCore
