   - Fix: Removed duplicate indices being created for key fields
   - Fix: Setting different value than default produces duplicated HasColumnType call in EF Core (See https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/58). Thanks to tdabek (https://github.com/tdabek) for the PR!
   - Fix: "Defining ColumnType causes error in generated DBContext" (See https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/64)
   - Fix: "EFCore indexed column not generated and support for multi column indexing" (See https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/62)

1.2.6.23
   - Fix for designer item not showing in Add Items dialog

1.2.6.22
   - Added code in EF6 templates to generate orphan cleanup (experimental)
   - Added API documentation to help those wishing to modify the T4 templates (WIP)
   - Fix for 1..1 and 0-1..0-1 associations in EF Core generated code
   - Entity constructor parameters normalized to help in JSON serialization/deserialization

   - Generation of column type overrides now generates valid override code in OnModelCreating
   - DbSet properties in DbContext generate as virtual to facilitate mocking

1.2.6.20
   - Fixed code generation issue where class and enum directory overrides were being ignored (See https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/36)
   - Fixed a problem that caused a hard crash when certain model properties were changed under certain conditions (See https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/38)

   - Fixed one last remaining code generation issue with concurrency properties
   - Added model's base class to property editor
   - Change in the behavior for enumeration initial values if the enumeration is [Flags]. See documentation for details.

1.2.6.13
   - Bugfix to remove unnecessary permission requests to push attributes down when deleting leaf nodes in an inheritance tree
   - Fix to workaround Visual Studio pulling in the wrong System.Net.Http reference. (See https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/296293/vs2017-1575-ignores-the-hintpath-and-take-the-syst.html)
   - Add EFModel.xsd to Visual Studio schema cache in order to avoid editor warnings for missing schema
   - Fixed template issue for non-English-language systems (where Microsoft Pluralization Service is unavailable)
   - Added compartment for association sources so Bidirectional associations would show up

1.2.6.11
   - Tweak to force association end roles to be correct when roles or multiplicities change
   - Attribute elements' "String Properties" don't appear unless the attribute is a string
   - Attribute elements' "Indexed Unique" property doesn't appear unless the attribute has "Indexed" equal to "True"
   - Fixed background color on attribute glyph in model explorer
   - Fixed foreground color on enum value glyph on design surface
   - Hid comments in model explorer because they just cluttered up the tree.
   - Associations now show up in their own compartment in a class on the design surface. Note that this changes the height of your elements, so the first time opening a model you may have to tweak your esthetics a bit.
   - Double-clicking a class or enum on the designer opens the generated code file, if it exists. If it doesn't exist, you're asked if you'd like to generate the model then, if you do, it tries again.
      - Known issue: EFCore/.NETCore and EFCore/.NETFramework projects won't ask to generate the code if they can't open the file; they just fail silently. All other EF/.NET combinations behave appropriately.

1.2.6.7
   - An entity's concurrency token property is no longer a required parameter in its constructor (https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/24)
   - Simplified cascade delete settings in property editor for associations

   - Missing files when generating code for .NET Core projects fixed
   - Tightened up and swatted some bugs in INotifyPropertyChanged handling. Added documentation to doc site for this feature (following up on https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/23)
   - Ensured multiline editing was available in property window for those properties that made sense

1.2.6.6
   - Deleting a generalization or superclass gives the choice of pushing attributes and associations down to the former child class(es)

1.2.6.5
   - Comment elements now wrap the text
   - Multiline editor available in property window for element comment descriptions and Comment element text
   - Xml format changed for .efmodel file - can't be loaded by any version < 1.2.6.3
   - Support for automatic migration to new model xml formats

1.2.6.2
   - Added XML docs to DbContext, DatabaseInitializer and DbMigrationsConfiguration
   - Enabled drag and drop reordering of enum values and class properties
   - Gave some color to the enum value glyph in the model explorer - it was so boring!
   - Class properties and enum values with warnings now show a warning icon on the design surface
   - Design surface has a property to turn on or off the display of the warning icons 
   - Recategorized a few "Misc" properties on the design surface

1.2.5.1
   - Addressed issue #20 - Abstract/inherited/TPC =code still there for abstract class (https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/20). While the
     discussion centered around abstract classes and TPC inheritance (which was behaving properly), it did uncover a problem with code generation when
     namespaces changed from class to class. 

1.2.5.0
   - Fix for issue #19 - Recognize "Id" as primary key on import (https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/19)

1.2.4.0
   - Retargeted immediate error and warning messages to Visual Studio output window rather than error window so they could be cleared
   - Added drag validation to Generalization (inheritance) tool
   - Automatically propagate enum name and value name changes to classes that use them

1.2.3.3
   - Reverted the selection of the node in the model explorer when an element is selected in the diagram. 
     Was causing bad user experience.
   - Fix for bad code generation when a class has multiple properties that each have an darabase index specified.

1.2.3.0
   - When element selected in model explorer, no longer highlights in orange but instead selects, centers and zooms the element.
     This was done because the color change flagged the model as modified, making the user either undo or save the changes to keep
     source control happy.
   - Selecting an element in the diagram also selects it in the model explorer
   - Fix for issue #12 - Cascade delete (https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/14). Added another enum value for delete behavior (now is Cascade, None and Default)
     and changed code generation to force no cascade delete if set to 'None' ('None' used to mean 'Use the default behavior', which is now, more explicitly, the 'Default'
     option).
   - Fix for issue #13 - Unique index not generated in EF6 (https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/13).
   - Fix for issue #14 - Table with two Primary keys not generated properly in context (https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/14). Many thanks to @Falthazar!
   - Fix for issue #18 - Adds ValueGeneratedNever if identity type is Manual (https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/pull/18). Again, hats off to @Falthazar!

      - Ability to tag model as a specific EF version (especially useful for EF Core as new capabilities are being added often)
      - Support for dependent (complex/owned) types 
      - Option to generate dependent types in a separate directory
      - Output directory overrides for classes and enums
      - On model save, can optionally automatically install EF NuGet packages for the model's EF type and version
      - Context menu action to expand and collapse selected classes and enums

     changing from EF6 to EFCore doesn't give a message, just changes the strategy.
   - Added IsFlags attribute (and matching validations and behavior) to Enums
   - NGENed extension assembly
