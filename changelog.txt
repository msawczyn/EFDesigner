2.0.0.0
   - Dropped support for Visual Studio 2017; was getting to be too much to keep the tool viable for that Visual Studio version.
   - It's now possible to have multiple diagrams for the same model, each showing a different view and synchronized as the model changes. Perfect for helping to understand large models.
   - Added ability to specify foreign key properties (See https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/55)
   - Foreign key properties have a unique glyph so they can be easily picked out of the crowd
   - Foreign key properties that are primary keys also have a unique but different glyph

   - Modified assembly parsers to find declared foreign keys and add them to the model appropriately
   - Added options dialog (Tools/Options/Entity Framework Visual Editor)
   - Added use of GraphViz for model layout (if installed and path is added to "Tools/Options/Entity Framework Visual Editor")
   - Added a default string max length to the options page for the designer 
   - Added switch to disable generation of classes and enumerations for those cases where they are coming from different assemblies but need to be in the model to avoid errors.
   - Added visual indicator on classes and enumerations where code generation is disabled
   - Added ability to override the base class of the generated DbContext to be something other than "DbContext"
   - Attributes can now be flagged as abstract in the same way classes can.
   - Join tables in many-to-many associations can now have custom names (EF6 only, until EFCore supports many-to-many cardinalities)
   - Renamed toolbox category to "EF Model Diagrams"
   - Enhanced display of model elements in the Visual Studio property window's object list
   - Removed MSAGL layouts. No one understood them anyway.

   - Fix: bad merge broke MaxLength and MinLength properties in entity string properties (See https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/103)
   - Fix: attribute parser ("edit as code" feature) didn't handle enumeration initial values well; it does now (See https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/104)
   - Fix: showing cascade delete in the designer worked inconsistently (See https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/108)
   - Fix: drag and drop developed regressions (See https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/112 and https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/114)

   - Removed visibility option for setters of automatic identity properties. 

1.3.0.6 
   - Added a model fixup for when user doesn't use full enumeration name for a property's initial value in an entity (See https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/82)
   - To more fully support DDD models, added a toggle for persisting either the property or its backing field (if not an autoproperty) for EFCore
   - Can now override the NotifyPropertyChanged value for an entity on a per-property and per-association basis
   - Fix: Removed stray quote marks in default values for string properties (See https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/86)
   - Fix: Minimum string length was ignored when setting properties via text edit (See https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/86)

   - Fix: Removed duplicate indices being created for key fields
   - Fix: Setting different value than default produces duplicated HasColumnType call in EF Core (See https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/58). Thanks to tdabek (https://github.com/tdabek) for the PR!

   - Fixed one last remaining code generation issue with concurrency properties
   - Added model's base class to property editor

1.2.6.13
   - Bugfix to remove unnecessary permission requests to push attributes down when deleting leaf nodes in an inheritance tree
   - Fix to workaround Visual Studio pulling in the wrong System.Net.Http reference. (See https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/296293/vs2017-1575-ignores-the-hintpath-and-take-the-syst.html)
   - Add EFModel.xsd to Visual Studio schema cache in order to avoid editor warnings for missing schema
   - Fixed template issue for non-English-language systems (where Microsoft Pluralization Service is unavailable)
   - Added compartment for association sources so Bidirectional associations would show up

1.2.6.11
   - Tweak to force association end roles to be correct when roles or multiplicities change
   - Attribute elements' "String Properties" don't appear unless the attribute is a string
   - Attribute elements' "Indexed Unique" property doesn't appear unless the attribute has "Indexed" equal to "True"
   - Fixed background color on attribute glyph in model explorer
   - Fixed foreground color on enum value glyph on design surface
   - Hid comments in model explorer because they just cluttered up the tree.
   - Associations now show up in their own compartment in a class on the design surface. Note that this changes the height of your elements, so the first time opening a model you may have to tweak your esthetics a bit.
   - Double-clicking a class or enum on the designer opens the generated code file, if it exists. If it doesn't exist, you're asked if you'd like to generate the model then, if you do, it tries again.
      - Known issue: EFCore/.NETCore and EFCore/.NETFramework projects won't ask to generate the code if they can't open the file; they just fail silently. All other EF/.NET combinations behave appropriately.

1.2.6.7
   - An entity's concurrency token property is no longer a required parameter in its constructor (https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/24)
   - Simplified cascade delete settings in property editor for associations

   - Missing files when generating code for .NET Core projects fixed
   - Tightened up and swatted some bugs in INotifyPropertyChanged handling. Added documentation to doc site for this feature (following up on https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/23)
   - Ensured multiline editing was available in property window for those properties that made sense

1.2.6.6
   - Deleting a generalization or superclass gives the choice of pushing attributes and associations down to the former child class(es)

1.2.6.5
   - Comment elements now wrap the text
   - Multiline editor available in property window for element comment descriptions and Comment element text
   - Xml format changed for .efmodel file - can't be loaded by any version < 1.2.6.3
   - Support for automatic migration to new model xml formats

1.2.6.2
   - Added XML docs to DbContext, DatabaseInitializer and DbMigrationsConfiguration
   - Enabled drag and drop reordering of enum values and class properties
   - Gave some color to the enum value glyph in the model explorer - it was so boring!
   - Class properties and enum values with warnings now show a warning icon on the design surface
   - Design surface has a property to turn on or off the display of the warning icons 
   - Recategorized a few "Misc" properties on the design surface

1.2.5.1
   - Addressed issue #20 - Abstract/inherited/TPC =code still there for abstract class (https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/20). While the
     discussion centered around abstract classes and TPC inheritance (which was behaving properly), it did uncover a problem with code generation when
     namespaces changed from class to class. 

1.2.5.0
   - Fix for issue #19 - Recognize "Id" as primary key on import (https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/19)

1.2.4.0
   - Retargeted immediate error and warning messages to Visual Studio output window rather than error window so they could be cleared
   - Added drag validation to Generalization (inheritance) tool
   - Automatically propagate enum name and value name changes to classes that use them

1.2.3.3
   - Reverted the selection of the node in the model explorer when an element is selected in the diagram. 
     Was causing bad user experience.
   - Fix for bad code generation when a class has multiple properties that each have an darabase index specified.

1.2.3.0
   - When element selected in model explorer, no longer highlights in orange but instead selects, centers and zooms the element.
     This was done because the color change flagged the model as modified, making the user either undo or save the changes to keep
     source control happy.
   - Selecting an element in the diagram also selects it in the model explorer
   - Fix for issue #12 - Cascade delete (https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/14). Added another enum value for delete behavior (now is Cascade, None and Default)
     and changed code generation to force no cascade delete if set to 'None' ('None' used to mean 'Use the default behavior', which is now, more explicitly, the 'Default'
     option).
   - Fix for issue #13 - Unique index not generated in EF6 (https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/13).
   - Fix for issue #14 - Table with two Primary keys not generated properly in context (https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/issues/14). Many thanks to @Falthazar!
   - Fix for issue #18 - Adds ValueGeneratedNever if identity type is Manual (https://github.com/msawczyn/EFDesigner/pull/18). Again, hats off to @Falthazar!

      - Can add INotifyPropertyChanged interface and implementation for entities
      - Ability to tag model as a specific EF version (especially useful for EF Core as new capabilities are being added often)

      - Output directory overrides for classes and enums
      - On model save, can optionally automatically install EF NuGet packages for the model's EF type and version

   - Changed version to 1.1.0 due to MEF capability

1.0.3.9
   - If no entities and model is using an unsupported inheritance strategy, 
     changing from EF6 to EFCore doesn't give a message, just changes the strategy.
   - Added IsFlags attribute (and matching validations and behavior) to Enums
   - NGENed extension assembly

1.0.3.8
