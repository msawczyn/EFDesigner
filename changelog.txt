1.2.1
   - Bug fix for inheritance strategy automatically changing to table-per-hierarchy if targeting EF Core

1.2.0 
   - New Features
      - Roslyn-based code analysis now allows dragging C# files onto the design surface to add or update classes and enums
      - Can add INotifyPropertyChanged interface and implementation for entities
      - Ability to tag model as a specific EF version (especially useful for EF Core as new capabilities are being added often)
      - Support for dependent (complex/owned) types 
      - Option to generate dependent types in a separate directory
      - Output directory overrides for classes and enums
      - On model save, can optionally automatically install EF NuGet packages for the model's EF type and version
      - Context menu action to expand and collapse selected classes and enums 
   - Enhancements
      - Added ability to add/edit enum values via text in the same way properties can be added/edited in classes
      - Property grid hides element properties if they're not appropriate for the EF version
      - Inheritance strategy automatically changes to table-per-hierarchy if targeting EF Core
      - Context property "Database Type" changed to "SqlServer Type" to better reflect what it does
      - Selecting an element in the Model Explorer highlights it on the diagram

1.1.0
   - Bug fixes for exceptions thrown when bad input to model attributes as text
   - Added MinLength string property (used in EF6 only as of this writing)
   - Modified attribute parser to accept MinLength
   - Added ColumnName property to model attribute
   - Added MEF extension capability (see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/modeling/extend-your-dsl-by-using-mef)
   - Added some unit tests
   - Added some documentation updates
   - Changed version to 1.1.0 due to MEF capability

1.0.3.9
   - If no entities and model is using an unsupported inheritance strategy, 
     changing from EF6 to EFCore doesn't give a message, just changes the strategy.
   - Added IsFlags attribute (and matching validations and behavior) to Enums
   - NGENed extension assembly

1.0.3.8
   - Fixed project item placement
   - Added change checks to diagram so dirty flag doesn't set when nothing changes
   - Added docs to solution for easier editing

1.0.3.7
   - Emergency bug fixes

1.0.3.6
   - Fixed parser errors when editing model attributes as text
   - Fixed error when auto-generating on save and design surface is not the active window
   - Fixed crash when used on non-English-language systems (where Microsoft Pluralization Service is unavailable)
   - Added option to generate warnings if no documentation
   - Standardized warning and error message structure
   - Added ability to choose 'None' DatabaseInitializer type; generates SetInitializer(null)

1.0.3.5
   - Enhanced portability between EF6 an EFCore

1.0.3.4
